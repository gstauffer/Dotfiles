# Dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles targeting zsh, nvim, tmux, and other various utilies I use regularly. 

At this time, they are not particularly extensively configured, and a lot will probably be added and/or changed over time. 

I manage these with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/); `stow nvim` will symlink the files within the nvim directory to the same relative positons in your home directory.
